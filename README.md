# ThighDemo

<!--[Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wilcrofter/ThighDemo.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wilcrofter/ThighDemo.jl)-->

Demonstration of Julia package [GenS](https://github.com/WilCrofter/GenS.jl) using overlapping cross sections of a phatom thigh as shown below. A work in progress at the moment, it will eventually display image recoveries based on simulated scans of the overlapping sections. Image recovery is expected to be more than 3dB better in the overlap region.
